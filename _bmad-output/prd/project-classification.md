# Project Classification

**Technical Type:** IoT/Embedded Device
**Domain:** General (Consumer Electronics)
**Complexity:** Low
**Project Context:** Brownfield - extending existing ESP32-C3 BLE HID system

The existing codebase provides a solid foundation with event-driven architecture (FreeRTOS queues), handler pattern for modes, and working BLE HID connectivity. New features will integrate with these established patterns.
