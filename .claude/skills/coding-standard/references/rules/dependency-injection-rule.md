# Dependency Injection

## Rule

Invert control by injecting dependencies rather than creating them internally. Classes should receive their dependencies from external sources, not construct them.

## When to Apply

- When you want loose coupling between components
- When you need to make code testable
- When dependencies may vary or be replaced
- When following SOLID principles (especially Dependency Inversion)
- When building modular, maintainable systems
- When you want to avoid hard-coded dependencies
- When implementing Inversion of Control (IoC)

## Benefits

- **Testability**: Easy to inject mock dependencies for testing
- **Loose Coupling**: Classes don't depend on concrete implementations
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations
- **Maintainability**: Dependencies explicit and visible
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused with different dependencies
- **Single Responsibility**: Classes focus on their logic, not dependency creation
- **Configuration**: Dependencies configured externally

## How to Apply

1. **Identify Dependencies**: Determine what external resources a class needs
2. **Define Interfaces**: Create interfaces for dependencies
3. **Constructor Injection**: Pass dependencies through constructor (preferred)
4. **Property Injection**: Set dependencies via properties (when needed)
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Injection Types

### Constructor Injection (Preferred)
- Dependencies required for object to function
- Makes dependencies explicit and mandatory
- Enables immutability

### Property/Setter Injection
- Optional dependencies
- Dependencies that can change after construction
- Less preferred, makes dependencies less obvious

### Method Injection
- Dependencies needed only for specific method
- Temporary or contextual dependencies

## Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies injected, not created internally
- [ ] Classes depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- [ ] Constructor injection used for required dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit and visible
- [ ] Easy to substitute mock objects for testing
- [ ] No use of `new` keyword for dependencies in class
- [ ] Follows Dependency Inversion Principle

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Service Layer** | Inject repositories and other services |
| **Controllers** | Inject services and validators |
| **Testing** | Inject mock dependencies |
| **Configuration** | Inject configuration objects |
| **Logging** | Inject logger instances |
| **Data Access** | Inject database connections or repositories |

## Comparison

| Approach | Testability | Coupling | Flexibility |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **DI** | High | Low | High |
| **Hard-coded** | Low | High | Low |
| **Service Locator** | Medium | Medium | Medium |

## Cautions

- Don't overuse - simple cases may not need DI
- Constructor with too many parameters indicates SRP violation
- Circular dependencies indicate design problems
