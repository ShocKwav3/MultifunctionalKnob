# Meaningful Names

## Rule

Use meaningful, self-documenting names for variables, functions, and classes. Names must clearly convey intent and purpose. Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.

## When to Apply

- When naming any variable, function, or class
- When comments are needed to explain what code does
- When refactoring unclear code
- When abbreviations obscure meaning
- When reviewing code for clarity

## Benefits

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Clear names eliminate need for comments
- **Easier Maintenance**: Intent is obvious to future developers
- **Better Collaboration**: Team members understand code faster
- **Reduced Errors**: Clear names prevent misunderstandings
- **Comments Focus on WHY**: Explain business rules and non-obvious decisions

## Checklist

- [ ] Names clearly convey purpose and intent
- [ ] Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood
- [ ] Boolean variables/functions use is/has/can prefixes
- [ ] Function names are verbs, classes are nouns
- [ ] Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
